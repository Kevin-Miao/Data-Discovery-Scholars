# Data-Discovery-Scholars

Welcome to the [Data Discovery Scholars]([http:](https://github.com/Kevin-Miao/Data-Discovery-Scholars). The program is a crossover between the UC Berkeley Data Discovery program and Data Scholars program. The former connects college students with real-life Data Science projects. The latter provides additional support and a community to historically underrepresented minority students. 

As part of this initiative, I have been involved with this over the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 as the lead Graduate Student Instructor. The materials I have created focus on developing research skills, but also gaining a general sense of what Data Science entails.
